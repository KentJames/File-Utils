The original purpose of this utility was to provide a small and lightweight frontend
to the crytographic services of the python library. This purpose has since been expanded
to incorporate different crytographic hashing methods such as RIPEMD which have been 
implemeneted externally to python.

The program is very simple and intuitive to use, one simply needs to select a file, 
select the crytographic function required and run the hashing method.

I welcome comments and critiques on my code and what I can improve so please take a look.



###KNOWN ISSUES###:

There is a known issue involving the PyQt4 framework and specifying filepaths on unmounted
filesystems. This causes python to crash out. For now, if you want to hash a file located
on an unmounted filesystem, you must mount the filesystem BEFORE starting HashUtility.
I hope to fix this problem in a later update. 


###TO DO###:

##QT UI:

#  Cleanup module package dependencies
#  Formatting of ascii/utf output
#  Finish Dialog Connections
#  Implement saveas feature for specific hash types
#
